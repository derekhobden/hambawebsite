                <p>Welcome to Hambacompare. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Hambacompare website and services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you may not access the Service.</p>

                <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of these Terms.

                <h2>1. Service Description</h2>

                <p>Hambacompare is an insurance comparison service that allows users to compare insurance quotes from various providers in South Africa. Our Service enables you to submit your insurance requirements once and receive multiple quotes from different insurance providers.</p>

                <p>We do not provide insurance directly or act as a broker. Hambacompare is a platform that collects information from customers and passes it on to the insurance providers that the customer specifically selects to proceed with. The actual insurance policies and any financial advice are provided by the insurance companies, not by Hambacompare. We are not authorized financial advisors and do not provide any financial or insurance advice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>

                <ul>

                    <li>The accuracy or completeness of the quotes provided</li>
                    <li>That the quotes will be the lowest available in the market</li>
                    <li>That you will qualify for the insurance policies quoted</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The final decision to provide insurance coverage rests solely with the insurance providers. The quotes you receive through our Service are subject to verification by the insurance providers and may change based on additional information they may require.</p>
