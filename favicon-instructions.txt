Favicon Instructions for Hambacompare Website

To complete the website, you'll need to create a favicon.ico file. Here's how to do it:

1. Create a simple logo or icon that represents Hambacompare (perhaps using the primary orange color #FB5630)
2. Save it as a square PNG image (at least 512x512 pixels for best quality across devices)
3. Convert the PNG to an ICO file using an online converter like https://favicon.io/ or https://www.favicon-generator.org/
4. Name the file "favicon.ico" and place it in the root directory of the website

The favicon is already referenced in all HTML files with:
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">

Once you've created the favicon.ico file, you can delete this instructions file.
